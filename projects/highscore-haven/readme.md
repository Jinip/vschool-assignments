# High Score Haven

In this project, we constructed a website where gamers could go to keep track of their high scores for the games they play. This project mainly tested our ability to build forms capable of submitting new content onto an existing web page and format tables. I went a little further than necessary to format the table data to overflow beneath the form to ensure the form remained in a determined place on the screen rather than shift as new rows were added.

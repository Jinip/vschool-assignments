# Diet Assist

This is the second full-stack app built for V School. This app allows a user to sign up and create quickly create a week-long meal plan customized to their personal needs based on age, sex, and body type.

Currently, this app is pulling from a limited database set up as a proof of concept. Eventually, I'd like for it to access a larger database capable of populating the meal plans based on the nutritional values of each recipe.

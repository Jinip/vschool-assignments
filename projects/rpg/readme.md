# Tay Tay Attack

This is a text-based adventure app testing parsing user input, utilizing nested loops, and constructing and utilizing objects. Requirements to pass off this project were to save a user's name, press w to walk triggering encounters, battling or running from encounters, and providing a win condition to exit the program. I decided to also incorporate an item system where the encountered enemies dropped items which the player could use in or out of battle, randomized dodge chance, and an administrator mode to load items for demonstration.

# Super Mario Pest Control

Princess Peach has put a bounty on the baddies of Mushroom Kingdom, and this application allows Mario to keep track of how many of each baddie he's eliminated and the running tally of his total payout. This project tested our use of CSS selectors and use of custom fonts. I decided to also incorporate Bootstrap grid formatting including collapsing images and custom media queries to adjust font size.
